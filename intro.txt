I will explain classes:
-Game
-GameWrapper
-AttakManager
-MyHub

- in Game class are all basic necessary bang functionis for which is not needed communication between multiple users trough internet,
like applying blue cards, or adding life or applying panic or cat balou

- GameWrapper contains Game class, GameWrapper takes care of everything that includes comunications between users (attacking and applying card miss)
this is taken care of by class AttackManager in variable Attacks, AttackManager contains list of threads that work as representation of attacks
with timers. If time on timer expires victim of attack takes damage, if victim will block attack before timer expires he will not take damage

-also GameWrapper and Game comunicate between eachother by reference to eachother

-MyHub is used for comunications to client throught javascript, MyHub has stored all connected users(might change, might work on login) and current games,
MyHub can call on functions in clients javascript and clients javascript can call MyHubs functions
